### **Neutral Investigative**

“It’s time to write the next big story, Journalist.”

Win Condition: Write 2 articles.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Impartial Sabotage (1 charge) - Select a green node, return the node to a white node, un-hacking the node. Connections to nodes ahead fail. Leaves a set of random connection logs, one of which is you. This gives a scoop.

Background Search (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Check a target operative’s background. You’ll be given a (non-unique) random skill that they have, either day or night. Do not go through frames or cover. This gives a scoop.

### **Night:**

Get Scoop (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack. Do not go through frames or cover. If the target is not a neutral, gain 1 scoop.

Write Article (0 charges) - Write an article. Needs 1 scoop at least.

Expose Operation Leader (1 charge) - Select a target operative. If they are the Operation Leader, gain 1 article immediately and reveal the Operation Leader globally. Visit and occupy them.

### **Passives:**

Adaptable Journalism - Gain 1 scoop if someone occupies you that is not neutral.

No Dirt On Me - You are unarrestable unless framed. You will know who attempted to arrest you.
