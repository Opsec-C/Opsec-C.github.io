### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“Let’s kill some people for the sake of killing people, Psychopath.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C). Opsec R requires you to kill all operatives once from the time you become the Neutral Killing role.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Background Search (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Check a target operative’s background. You’ll be given a (non-unique) random skill that they have, either day or night. Do not go through frames or cover.

Impersonate (1 charge) - Permanently rename your operative to whatever name you want. If you name it the same as another operative, targeting that operative will randomly target either operative of the same name.

Hold Opsec Hostage (2 charges) - You can write one message to talk to all players in a specialized channel (global Opsec info). This message can appear when you want it tonight.

### **Night:**

Hold Hostage - Select a target operative and hold their family hostage, visiting and occupying them. The operative will be forced to murder someone of your choice or die. The operative sent to murder the other operative cannot be occupied, and the selected operative will visit the target and murder them. Cannot repeatedly use this on the same operative.

Psychopath’s Murder - Select an operative and murder them. Visit the target and remove their logs and role.

Doxx and Stalk (N1 -> N4 cooldown, 2 charges) - Select a target operative. Do not go through frames or cover. Learn this operative’s faction alignment and visit them.

### **Passives:**

Psychopath’s Fake Operatives - Psychopath is designed in which the other N operatives that you own are all automatically thrown under the bus as soon as any arrest or murder attempts happen. By default, Psychopath should have the other N operatives simply be test dummies of himself, shielding all attacks for him with the Throw Under the Bus message and revealing a Psychopath test dummy.

Psychopath’s Cover - You can select any role to cover yourself, which lasts until Day 4.

Raid Boss - Avoid the first two arrest or murder attempts on you. (Either use this passive or Psychopath’s Fake Operatives).
