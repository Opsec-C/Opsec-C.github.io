### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“Astra playing Untrusted is beeg problem, Astra is beeg ritard and make beeg mistake, buy pistal, is beeg problem when beeg ritard get field agent and get beeg sting, Italian Mafia.”

(Love you Knu, all of this is satire).

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C). Opsec R requires you to kill all operatives once from the time you become the Neutral Killing role.

### **Day:**

Beeg Problem - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. However, it is a beeg problem and you can’t hack it. Does absolutely nothing but leaves a log.

Plumb Node - Select a green node and attempt to plumb it. Does absolutely nothing but leaves a log.

Uninstall Untrusted (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Select a target operative and disable all day actions related to the topology done by them.

### **Night:**

Italian Greeting - Select a target operative and visit them. Does not gain any intel.

Mafia Meet (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack. Do not reveal yourself to them.

They Eat Pineapple Pizza (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Attempt to kill the operative with local mafia. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

Together Strong - All of your operatives are designed to be Italian Mafia clones. If you die or get arrested in Opsec R, your role will be encrypted, and you will return as the Italian Mafia until you complete your objective, get voted, or accept a Deal.
