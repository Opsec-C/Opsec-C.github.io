### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“Astra playing Untrusted is beeg problem, Astra is beeg ritard and make beeg mistake, buy pistal, is beeg problem when beeg ritard get field agent and get beeg sting, Italian Mafia.”

(Love you Knu, all of this is satire).

Win Condition: Eliminate the majority of all hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C).

### **Day:**

Beeg Problem (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. However, it is a beeg problem and you can’t hack it. Does absolutely nothing but leaves a log.

Plumb Node (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Select a green node and attempt to plumb it. Does absolutely nothing but leaves a log.

Uninstall Untrusted (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Select a target operative and disable all day actions related to the topology done by them.

### **Night:**

Italian Greeting - Select a target operative and visit them. Does not gain any intel.

Mafia Meet (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack. 

They Eat Pineapple Pizza - Select a target operative. Attempt to kill the operative with local mafia. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

Together Strong - You can die or get arrested, but your deaths and arrests are not public, and you simply change your operative name after the next day to a name of your choice (or not changed). You cannot die unless you get voted out.
