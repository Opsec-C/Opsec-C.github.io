### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“Light the fuse and drop the artillery, Bombardier.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C). Opsec R requires you to kill all operatives once from the time you become the Neutral Killing role.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Plant Fake Info - Decreases hacking chances on a random node.

### **Night:**

Signal Flare (3 charges) - If you are attempted to be arrested tonight, whoever attempted to arrest you will be announced to you. Will avoid the arrest as an additional charge to Raid Boss.

False Alarm (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Occupy the operative without visiting them, as they will be alarmed by the ordnance you launch at their hideout. Gives the same text as Midnight Meet.

Mark Target - Select a target operative and mark their hideout. Visit the target.

KABOOM! - Kill all operatives that have been marked, regardless of defensives.

### **Passives:**

Raid Boss - Avoid the first two arrest or murder attempts on you.

Ground Operative - Specialization is always shown as field ops or utility, you pick.
