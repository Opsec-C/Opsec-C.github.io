### **Neutral Killing**

<span class="nk">
This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

<span class="nk">
“You were once in a fighting ring, but now that the ring has dissipated, you are here trying to start a new ring, Underground Ring Fighter.”

<span class="nk">
Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C). Opsec R requires you to kill all operatives once from the time you become the Neutral Killing role.

### **Day:**

<span class="nk">
Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

<span class="nk">
Bait Law Enforcement (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Select a target operative, inform agents that the target is one working for Netsec. (Leaves the same message as Bounty Hunter’s Spill the Beans).

### **Night:**

<span class="nk">
Follow (2 charges) - Select a target operative and follow them, visiting them and checking if they left their hideout and met anyone. If they were occupied, you’d only know that they could not leave their hideout.

<span class="nk">
Smash Hardware (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select an operative and disable all day actions related to the topology. Occupies and visits them. (Same as Midnight Meet).

<span class="nk">
Interrogate (3 charges) - Select a target operative and occupy them. The host will ask them for their logs, giving you what they send.

<span class="nk">
To the Arena (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select up to four operatives. Each of these operatives will be occupied and put in a battle to the death, with only one operative that can make it out. The order of winning the battle is as follows: Neutrals > Agents > W3C > Paragon > Netsec, and Special > Field Ops > Social > Investigative > Utility > Offensive. A tie will result in both dying. Each operative will be occupied and death is not dodgeable. Do not visit them.

### **Passives:**

<span class="nk">
Raid Boss - Avoid the first two arrest or murder attempts on you.

<span class="nk">
Ground Operative - Specialization is always shown as field ops or utility, you pick.
