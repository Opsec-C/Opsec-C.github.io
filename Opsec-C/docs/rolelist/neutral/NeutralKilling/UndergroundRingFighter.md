### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“You were once in a fighting ring, but now that the ring has dissipated, you are here trying to start a new ring, Underground Ring Fighter.”

Win Condition: Eliminate the majority of all hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C).

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Bait Law Enforcement - Select a target operative, inform agents that the target is one working for Netsec. Can be yourself. (Leaves the same message as Bounty Hunter’s Spill the Beans).

Broadcast Message (1 charge) - You can write one message to talk to all players in a specialized channel (global Opsec info). This message can appear when you want it tonight.

### **Night:**

Follow (2 charges) - Select a target operative and follow them, visiting them and checking if they left their hideout and met anyone. If they were occupied, you’d only know that they could not leave their hideout.

Smash Hardware (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select an operative and disable all day actions related to the topology. Occupies and visits them. (Same as Midnight Meet).

Interrogate (3 charges) - Select a target operative and occupy them. The host will ask them for their logs, giving you what they send.

Call Backup (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Escort yourself. If you are targeted by an arrest or murder, attack them right back, killing the arrester or murderer.

To the Arena (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select up to four operatives. Each of these operatives will be occupied and put in a battle to the death, with only one operative that can make it out. The order of winning the battle is as follows: Neutrals > Agents > W3C > Paragon > Netsec, and Special > Field Ops > Social > Investigative > Utility > Offensive. A tie will result in all dying. Each operative will be occupied and death is not dodgeable. Do not visit them.

### **Passives:**

Raid Boss - Avoid the first two arrest or murder attempts on you.

Ground Operative - Specialization is always shown as field ops or utility, you pick.
