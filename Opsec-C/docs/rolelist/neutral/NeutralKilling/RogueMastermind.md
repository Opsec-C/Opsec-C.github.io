### **Neutral Killing**

<span class="nk">
This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

<span class="nk">
“Project Havoc is waiting for your careful execution, Rogue Mastermind.”

<span class="nk">
Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C). Opsec R requires you to kill all operatives once from the time you become the Neutral Killing role.

### **Day:**

<span class="nk">
Hack Target (Very High) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

<span class="nk">
Application Layer Attack (2 charges) - Select a green or white node and block all connections to the node this day. Up to 2 random operatives who targeted this node today will be infected.

<span class="nk">
Worm Attack - Select a target operative that has been infected. You can see the operative’s action space and choose what that operative does today. Cannot repeatedly use this on the same operative.

<span class="nk">
Activate Project Havoc (D1 -> D3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Kill all infected operatives.

### **Night:**

<span class="nk">
Infect Operative (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack and infecting their hardware. Do not reveal yourself to them. (Works like Midnight Meet).

<span class="nk">
Expunge Hacker - Select a green node and kill the operative that hacked the node.

<span class="nk">
Activate Project Havoc (N1 -> N3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Kill all infected operatives.

### **Passives:**

<span class="nk">
Mastermind’s Entourage - Rogue Mastermind is designed in which the other N operatives that you own are all automatically thrown under the bus as soon as any arrest or murder attempts happen. By default, Rogue Mastermind should have the other N operatives simply be holograms of himself, shielding all attacks for him with the Throw Under the Bus message and revealing a “Rogue Mastermind” hologram.

<span class="nk">
Hardcoded Routing Procedures - You will gain access to the exact role of all infected operatives.

<span class="nk">
Mastermind’s Cover - You can select any role to cover yourself, which lasts until Day 4.

<span class="nk">
Raid Boss - Avoid the first two arrest or murder attempts on you. (Either use this passive or Psychopath’s Fake Operatives).
