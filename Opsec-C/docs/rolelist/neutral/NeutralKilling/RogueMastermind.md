### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“Project Havoc is waiting for your careful execution, Rogue Mastermind.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C). Opsec R requires you to kill all operatives once from the time you become the Neutral Killing role.

### **Day:**

Hack Target (Very High) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Application Layer Attack (2 charges) - Select a green or white node and block all connections to the node this day. Up to 2 random operatives who targeted this node today will be infected.

Worm Attack - Select a target operative that has been infected. You can see the operative’s action space and choose what that operative does today. Cannot repeatedly use this on the same operative.

Activate Project Havoc (D1 -> D3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Kill all infected operatives.

### **Night:**

Infect Operative (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack and infecting their hardware. Do not reveal yourself to them. (Works like Midnight Meet).

Expunge Hacker - Select a green node and kill the operative that hacked the node.

Activate Project Havoc (N1 -> N3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Kill all infected operatives.

### **Passives:**

Mastermind’s Entourage - Rogue Mastermind is designed in which the other N operatives that you own are all automatically thrown under the bus as soon as any arrest or murder attempts happen. By default, Rogue Mastermind should have the other N operatives simply be holograms of himself, shielding all attacks for him with the Throw Under the Bus message and revealing a “Rogue Mastermind” hologram.

Hardcoded Routing Procedures - You will gain access to the exact role of all infected operatives.

Mastermind’s Cover - You can select any role to cover yourself, which lasts until Day 4.

Raid Boss - Avoid the first two arrest or murder attempts on you. (Either use this passive or Psychopath’s Fake Operatives).
