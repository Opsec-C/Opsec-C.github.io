### **Neutral Killing**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“Project Havoc is waiting for your careful execution, Rogue Mastermind.”

Win Condition: Eliminate the majority of all hostile units (Netsec, Agents, and W3C).

### **Day:**

Hack Target (Very High) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Application Layer Attack (2 charges) - Select a green or white node and block all connections to the node this day. Up to 2 random operatives who targeted this node today will be infected.

Hack Private Channel (1 charge) - You can write one message to talk to all players in ASC or W3C channels, speaking directly to only Agent and/or W3C players, which appears next night.

Activate Project Havoc (D1 -> D3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Kill all infected operatives at night.

### **Night:**

Infect Operative - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack and infecting their hardware. (Works like Midnight Meet).
