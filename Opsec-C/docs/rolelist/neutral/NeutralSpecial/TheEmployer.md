### **Neutral Special**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“This Opsec is too important to be left in the hands of an incompetent leader, Employer.”

Win Condition: Hack the target node, or ransom the OL’s computer and give it to someone who isn't an agent.

### **Day:**

Hack Target (High) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Ransom Computer - Select a target operative. If the target operative has the ability to root, steal the ability to root, remove the current root, and grant 1 charge of Give Root Access.

Jam Network (2 charges) - Select a target operative and disable all day actions related to the topology done by them.

Broadcast Message (1 charge) - You can write one message to talk to all players in a specialized channel (global Opsec info). This message can appear when you want it tonight.

Give Root Access (0 charge) - Select an operative to give root to. They become any of Operation Leader, Blackmailed Leader, Sociopath Leader, W3C Operation Leader, Paragon Operation Leader, or are simply an agent, neutral, Paragon Leader, or W3C Leader with access to the special channel. A Neutral Leader can only spawn in.

### **Night:**

Midnight Meet (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack. Do not reveal yourself to them.

Emergency Extraction (N1 -> N3 cooldown, 3 charges) - Select an operative to escort, does not occupy them and makes them immune to everything unless otherwise stated.

Special Orders (1 charge) - Select an operative and murder them. Occupies but does NOT visit the target.

### **Passives:**

Authority - You have two votes.

Lack of Leadership - If you are rooted and the original Operation Leader dies, instead of becoming the Operation Leader, gain a charge of Give Root Access.

No Dirt On Me - You are unarrestable unless framed. You do not know who attempted to arrest you.

The Big Fish - Whoever arrests you gets two STING charges. Doesn’t have to be an agent.

Employer’s Camouflage - Pick your class that you are entirely framed as, which you will then have all intel abilities follow that frame. This does not remove No Dirt On Me.
