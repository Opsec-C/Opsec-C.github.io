In the Force (Pick 1)

=======================================================================

Fake Escort - Escort a target operative, but leave as soon as trouble comes, letting the original target die or get arrested. Visit and occupy them. Must select a different target the next night.

Follow (2 charges) - Select a target operative and follow them, visiting them and checking if they left their hideout and met anyone. If they were occupied, you’d only know that they could not leave their hideout.

Interrogate (3 charges) - Select a target operative and occupy them. The host will ask them for their logs, giving you what they send.

### **Passives:**

No Dirt On Me - You are unarrestable unless framed.

In the Force - Pick an ability between Fake Escort, Follow, and Interrogate.

High Priority Targets - All special roles of any faction, Neutral Killings, and core agent roles are worth 2 bounties instead of 1.
