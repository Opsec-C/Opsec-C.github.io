### **Neutral Field Operations**

“You were once a bodyguard of a high-profile agency, but after an assassination on your target’s life succeeded, you went to Netsec, Former Bodyguard.”

Win Condition: Protect 3 Netsec targets, or protect a target from arrest or murder. (This can include blocking an arrest or murder attempt with Bouncer). Or win as an enforcer.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Bait Law Enforcement (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Select a target operative, inform agents that the target is one working for Netsec. (Leaves the same message as Bounty Hunter’s Spill the Beans).

Join the Force (1 charge) - Become an enforcer.

### **Night:**

Escort - Escort a target operative, protecting the operative from arrests and murders. Arrest attempts will arrest this operative instead, and anyone attempting to murder the protected operative will be killed. Visit and occupy them. Must select a different target the next night.

Bouncer (N1 -> N3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Select a target operative. You will visit and occupy them like a Midnight Meet, and anyone who visits them will be occupied, like a Misdirection.

### **Passives:**

Bulletproof Vest - Avoid the first arrest or murder attempt on you. After being arrested or murder attempted, become immune to occupation.
