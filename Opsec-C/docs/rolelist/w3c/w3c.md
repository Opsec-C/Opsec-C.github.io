The Really Really Bad Guys

“We are here to get rid of NETSEC scum. Let’s get rid of these guys, and let’s get rid of agents or we’ll have problems later.”

Win condition: Prevent the hack from completing on time.

Main difference from Agent is that Agent has more direct ways of killing (singular killer/FA usually), whereas W3C needs to kill sporadically using specific niche ways to kill. W3C also doesn’t have topology access, but still maintains a connected chat. W3C gains more power the less operatives they have, or gains power with more kills.
