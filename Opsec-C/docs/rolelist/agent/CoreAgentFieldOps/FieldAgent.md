### **Night:**

Arrest - Select a target operative and arrest them. Visit them.

Sting (1 charge) - Select a target operative and arrest them, along with anyone that visits them. Do not visit them.

Interrogate (3 charges) - Select a target operative and occupy them. The host will ask them for their logs, giving you what they send.
