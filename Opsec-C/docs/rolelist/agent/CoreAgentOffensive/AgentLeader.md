### **Core Agent Offensive**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“You must stop the hack at any cost, Agent Leader.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, W3C, and Neutral Killing). Opsec R requires the hack to not be complete in time.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Hack Target (Moderate) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Download Intel - Select a green node and attempt to download from it. If there is intel, and you download and remove it first, you will get class intel, target node, or faction intel. Do not go through frames or cover. Leaves a log.

Impersonate (1 charge) - Permanently rename your operative to whatever name you want. If you name it the same as another operative, targeting that operative will randomly target either operative of the same name.

Rollback (1 charge) - Select a green node, return the node to a white node, un-hacking the node. Connections to nodes ahead fail.

All in (1 charge) - Turn into a Field Agent. Can only be done if there are no Agent on the Field roles.
