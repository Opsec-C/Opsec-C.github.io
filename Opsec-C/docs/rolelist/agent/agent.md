The Good Guys

“We need to shut this hacking operation down.”

Win condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units, or at least 1 hostile unit per day/night phase.

Agents have more ways to directly arrest and kill than other factions. Agents have access to the topology and a unique chat (ASC).

Note that Agents cannot win on a single root from Netsec, instead moles turn into a Blackmailed Leader, and other roles turn into an agent with broadcast access and authority.
