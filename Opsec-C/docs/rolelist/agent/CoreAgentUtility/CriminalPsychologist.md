### **Core Agent Utility**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset; one Agent on the Field must spawn.

“You know exactly how to get them, Criminal Psychologist.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units, or at least 1 hostile unit per day/night phase.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Background Search (D1 -> D3 cooldown) - Check a target operative’s background. You’ll be given a (non-unique) random skill that they have, either day or night. Do not go through frames or cover.

### **Night:**

Insanity (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select two target operatives. The first operative will go insane and attempt to disorganized murder the second operative. Visit and occupy them.

Throw Under the Bus (2 charges) - Select a target operative. All skills used on you will be used on the target operative.

Misdirection (1 charge) - Occupy anyone that visits you directly, blocking any attempts to visit, occupy, and kill directly. Does not save you from Raids, Stings, and other indirect methods of killing this operative.

### **Passives:**

Agent on the Field - You are a Field Agent role.

Turncoats - You are allowed to have Initiators, Specialists, and Operators.
