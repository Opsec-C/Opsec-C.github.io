### **Core Agent Utility**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset; one Agent on the Field must spawn.

“You might be a slimy prison guard who wants to execute every prisoner to sate your sadism, but you were hired by agents anyway, Jail Warden.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Netsec, W3C, and Neutral Killing). Opsec R requires the hack to not be complete in time.

### **Day:**

Create Hideout (D1 -> D4 cooldown, 2 charges) - Grants you one charge of Move Hideout.

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Plant Fake Info - Decreases hacking chances on a random node.

Temporary Jail Time - Select a target operative and jail them for the night. They will receive a similar outcome as Bouncer, like if you visit and occupy them without revealing yourself, and anyone who visits them will be occupied, like a Misdirection. Gain a charge of Arrest on Warrant.

### **Night:**

Move Hideout (1 charge) - Move your hideout, protecting yourself unless you are occupied.

Dumpster Dive - Increases hacking chances on a random node.

Interrogate (3 charges) - Select a target operative and occupy them. The host will ask them for their logs, giving you what they send.

Torture (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select a target operative and occupy them. Torture the operative enough in which they cannot do anything the next day or night, as they will be in severe pain. Visit and occupy them.

Arrest on Warrant (0 charges) - Arrest the target in jail, as you have determined them guilty. If you do not do this, the operative will be released tomorrow. Cannot arrest unarrestable targets, since they will either escape or are legally unarrestable.

### **Passives:**

Agent on the Field - You are a Field Agent role.

Prison Guard - You can send someone to jail or arrest them and do an extra action per day or night.
