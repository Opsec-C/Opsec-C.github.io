### **Netsec Offensive**

“Your history in computers and networks will help greatly, Network Specialist.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units.

### **Day:**

Hack Target (Moderate) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Probe Node - Select a white node, increasing hacking chances of getting this node. Strongest hacking chance buff. Leaves a log.

Wireshark (D1 -> D4 cooldown) - Tells you the name of any operative that did a Denial of Service.

### **Night:**

Cover Your Tracks (2 charges) - Move your hideout, protecting yourself unless you are occupied. Arrest attempts will show a result similar to a target that is immune to arrest, like No Dirt On Me.

Review Connection Logs (2 charges) - Selects a target operative. Check if their connection was altered through ISP Isolation or Jam Network the previous day, and make them immune to ISP Isolation or Jam Network the following day. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

Network Insights - For every Hack Target used on a node, you get a higher hack chance to get the node.
