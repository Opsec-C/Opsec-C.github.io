### **Netsec Offensive**

“You don’t have high clearance at the target company, but any little bit helps. Cash out and get out, Inside Man (Software Engineer).”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing). Opsec R needs to hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Hack Target (Very Low) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Download Intel - Select a green node and attempt to download from it. If there is intel, and you download and remove it first, you will get class intel, target node, or faction intel. Do not go through frames or cover. Leaves a log.

Insider Knowledge (D1 -> D3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Tells you the IP of a node with downloadable intel on it.

Plant Keylogger (1 charge) - Grants you one charge of Retrieve Keylogger.

### **Night:**

Retrieve Keylogger (1 charge) - Select a node, making it easier to hack. Grants you one charge of Plant Keylogger.

Replace Server (N1 -> N3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Replace a selected server with a laptop by connecting a company laptop to future nodes and disconnecting the server.

### **Passives:**

Target Knowledge - You can see which node is the final target. This target will not win the game outright, but will allow you to gain significant global intel if hacked. This is the win condition for Opsec R.
