### **Netsec Utility**

“You don’t have high clearance at the target company, but any little bit helps. Cash out and get out, Inside Man (Assistant).”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing). Opsec R needs to hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Insider Knowledge (D1 -> D3 cooldown, 2 charges) - Tells you the IP of a node with downloadable intel on it.

Plant Keylogger (1 charge) - Grants you one charge of Retrieve Keylogger.

Desperate Measures (1 charge) - Turn into an Improvised Hacker.

### **Night:**

Follow (2 charges) - Select a target operative and follow them, visiting them and checking if they left their hideout and met anyone. If they were occupied, you’d only know that they could not leave their hideout.

Retrieve Keylogger (0 charges) - Select a node, making it easier to hack. Grants you one charge of Plant Keylogger.

Dumpster Dive - Increases hacking chances on a random node.

### **Passives:**

Target Knowledge - You can see which node is the final target. This target will not win the game outright, but will allow you to gain significant global intel if hacked. This is the win condition for Opsec R.
