### **Netsec Investigative**

“You are an expert in linguistics and Natural Language Processing, Natural Linguist.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing), or hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Hack Target (Low) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Impersonate (1 charge) - Permanently rename your operative to whatever name you want. If you name it the same as another operative, targeting that operative will randomly target either operative of the same name.

Log Analysis - Select a green node and clear any fake logs from Alter Logs or Rollback.

### **Night:**

Speech Analysis (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Start with a random operative. Select a target operative and compare their speech, checking if they can win together. Do not go through frames or cover. Visit them.

LSTM Speech Recognition (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative and check if any talking happened in that operative’s hideout. If there was a Midnight Meet of some sort, get that knowledge. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

None.
