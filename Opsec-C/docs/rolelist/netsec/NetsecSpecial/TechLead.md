### **Netsec Special**

This role is supposed to be unique, depending on the ruleset.

“You are one of the best operatives, hackers, and leaders Netsec has ever seen, but you decided not to lead this Operation, Tech Lead.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing), or hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Hack Target (Very High) - Select a white node and attempt to hack it. Leaves a log.

Download Intel - Select a green node and attempt to download from it. If there is intel, and you download and remove it first, you will get class intel, target node, or faction intel. Do not go through frames or cover. Leaves a log.

Denial of Service (2 charges) - Select a green or white node and block all connections to the node this day. Do not leave a log.

0-Day Exploit (1 charge) - Select a white node and instantly hack it. Leaves a log.

Give Root Access (0 charges) - Select an operative to give root to. They become any of Operation Leader, Blackmailed Leader, Sociopath Leader, W3C Operation Leader, Paragon Operation Leader, or are simply an agent, neutral, Paragon Leader, or W3C Leader with access to the special channel. A Neutral Leader can only spawn in.

### **Night:**

Midnight Meet (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack. Do not reveal yourself to them.

Investigate Hideout (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. You will learn who they visited, and their subclass. Do not go through frames or cover. Visit them.

Advisor (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative, their hacking chance temporarily increases by one stage. Visit them.

Misdirection (1 charge) - Occupy anyone that visits you directly, blocking any attempts to visit, occupy, and kill directly. Does not save you from Raids, Stings, and other indirect methods of killing this operative.

### **Passives:**

Lack of Leadership - If you are rooted and the original Operation Leader dies, instead of becoming the Operation Leader, gain a charge of Give Root Access.

The Tech Lead - Have an unfathomable ego, preventing anyone from occupying you in the evening since you refuse to listen to people.
