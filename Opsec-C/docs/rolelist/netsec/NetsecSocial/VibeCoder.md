### **Netsec Social**

“The new age of coding allows you to know nothing and still code, Vibe Coder.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing). Opsec R needs to hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Vibe Code - Select a white node and randomly use a low chance hack or jam your own network, preventing you from hacking. Leaves a log if using a hack.

Seek Deepseek - Ask an LLM to tell you a fact about the opsec. Do not go through frames or cover. Download Intel without leaving a connection log. Sometimes returns fake intel.

### **Night:**

AI Seminar (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about LLMs. If you want to, you can use a charge of doxx and ask chatgpt at the same time. (Same as Midnight Meet).

Doxx and Ask Chatgpt (N1 -> N4 cooldown, 2 charges) - Select a target operative. Do not go through frames or cover. Learn a faction that the operative is not aligned with and visit them.

Advice from LLM (N1 -> N4 cooldown) - Select a target operative, lower their hack chance by one stage for the next day, but make them gain hack chance by one stage of their original hack chance the day after. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

Just Ask Copilot - If asked the right question, they will learn that you can’t hack.
