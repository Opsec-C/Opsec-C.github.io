### **Netsec Social**

“The new age of coding allows you to know nothing and still code, Vibe Coder.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing). Opsec R needs to hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Vibe Code - Select a white node and randomly use a low chance hack or harden node, decreasing hacking chances of getting this node. Strongest hacking chance nerf. Leaves a log.

Ask LLM - Ask an LLM to tell you a fact about the opsec. Do not go through frames or cover. Download Intel without leaving a connection log. Sometimes returns fake intel.

### **Night:**

AI Seminar (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about LLMs. If you want to, you can use a charge of doxx and ask chatgpt at the same time. (Same as Midnight Meet).

Doxx and Ask Chatgpt (N1 -> N4 cooldown, 2 charges) - Select a target operative. Do not go through frames or cover. Learn a faction that the operative is not aligned with and visit them.

Advice from LLM (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative and lower their hack chance by one stage. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

Just Ask Chatgpt - If asked the right question, they will learn that you can’t hack.
