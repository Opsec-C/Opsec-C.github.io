### **Netsec Field Operations**

“You are a performance artist, but you were hired by Netsec to fulfill their fantasies, Dungeon Master.”

Win Condition: Eliminate ALL hostile units (Agents, W3C, and Neutral Killing), or hack the target node.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Temporary Dungeon Time - Select a target operative and put them in the dungeon for the night. They will receive a similar outcome as Bouncer, like if you visit and occupy them without revealing yourself, and anyone who visits them will be occupied, like a Misdirection. Gain a charge of Dungeon Arrest only if you have had not arrested more than 1 person. (Maximum 2 arrest attempts per game).

Desperate Measures (1 charge) - Turn into an Improvised Hacker.

### **Night:**

Dungeon Arrest (0 charges) - Arrest the target in the dungeon, as you have determined them guilty. If you do not do this, the operative will be released tomorrow. Cannot arrest unarrestable targets, since they will either escape or are legally unarrestable.

Dumpster Dive - Increases hacking chances on a random node.

### **Passives:**

None.
