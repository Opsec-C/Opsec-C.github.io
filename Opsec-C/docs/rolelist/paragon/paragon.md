Paragon is sorta a neutral faction that needs to kill off half of every faction. Can win with any faction and will lose if all other factions besides one lose before they win. This faction should spawn with SOME kill power, not necessarily a ton, but enough to be able to force a 50% on all other factions. Paragon will be notified if a faction reaches under 50% of their total operatives.
