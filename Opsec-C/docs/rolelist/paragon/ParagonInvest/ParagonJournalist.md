### **Paragon Investigative**

“Your investigative journalism skills will shine through today, Paragon Journalist.”

Win Condition: Make all factions have only 50% of their operatives, including Netsec, W3C, and agents. Opsec R requires the current W3C and agent operative to die once.

### **Day:**

Unskilled Attack - Select a node, green or white. Leaves a log.

Fake Denial of Service (2 charges) - Select a green or white node and fake blocking all connections to the node this day. Do not leave a log.

Rollback (1 charge) - Select a green node, return the node to a white node, un-hacking the node. Connections to nodes ahead fail.

Broadcast Message (1 charge) - You can write one message to talk to all players in a specialized channel (global Opsec info). This message can appear when you want it tonight.

### **Night:**

Get Scoop (N1 -> N3 cooldown) - Select a target operative. Visit and occupy them, talking about the hack. Do not reveal yourself to them. Find if the target is not neutral.

Uplift Paragon - Select a Paragon operative. For tonight, they are immune to occupation. Visit them.

### **Passives:**

Not Netsec - Your true faction is Neutral.
