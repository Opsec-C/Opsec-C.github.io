- Any faction can have wiretap, alter logs, ISP, rollback, wipe, encrypt logs, frame, arrest, murder, 0-day, and more. No matter how “against” or “for” Netsec an ability is, the ability can be in any role. Be creative!
- You can use disorganized murder, desperate measures, and any time gated ability from the first day.
- Plea deal does NOT exist mechanically from Agents. Moles can spawn from day 1.
- Almost every role has the ability to unskilled attack and/or hack, including field ops roles.
- Cameras on any role do NOT get seen by other roles with cameras.
- Escort and Fake Escort can only select the same target every other day.
- Cover Your Tracks leaves a notification that the target was unarrestable.
- ISP/Jam Network can be used to block DDOS, rollbacks, and other abilities.
- DDOS is globally announced again.
- Review Connection Logs also makes you immune to Jam Network for tomorrow.
- Impersonate allows you to rename your operative to allow for a 50% chance to target either operative. Troll Operative allows you to change another operative’s name.
- Ask the Right Question gives the operative’s hack chance too.
- Doxx works similarly to default Untrusted.
- Midnight Meet is designed to have prosopagnosia on by default (cannot see who met).
- Every player is immune to every third general occupational ability (Midnight Meet, escort, interrogate, ISP/Jam, etc).
- Review Specialization checks subclass.
- Speech Analysis checks if operatives can win together.
- For the Cause hunts moles.
- Wiretap checks for vote power and whether a player is forced to vote another player.
- Review TCP determines if you hacked or not.
- Frame, cover, and ability pool can be selected by the player rather than forced randomly.
- Voting can be silent, shown, or forced.
- There are abilities that can use Broadcast that aren’t Operation Leader.
- There are abilities to manually upload intel for others to download.
- Agents can be arrested when framed. Yep.
- Only Journalist will know who tried to arrest them.
- Root does not instantly lose or win the game. Moles or non-leader subfaction roles may choose to become the Operation Leader or stay the same role with broadcast. Core Agents who get root will simply get the ability to broadcast.
- The Operation Leader may not be Netsec aligned. The Operation Leader slot may not spawn.
- The Agent Leader is now an offensive subclass role. The Agent Leader slot may not spawn.
- There are many other changes, but these are the critical ones.
