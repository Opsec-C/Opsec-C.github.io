- Any faction can have wiretap, alter logs, ISP, rollback, wipe, encrypt logs, frame, arrest, murder, 0-day, and more. No matter how “against” or “for” Netsec an ability is, the ability can be in any role. Be creative!
- You can use disorganized murder, desperate measures, and any time gated ability from the first day.
- Plea deal does NOT exist mechanically from Agents. You start from your faction (or are converted through your own choices).
- Almost every role has the ability to unskilled attack and/or hack, including field ops roles.
- Cameras on any role do NOT get seen by other roles with cameras.
- Escort and Fake Escort can only select the same target every other day.
- Cover Your Tracks leaves a notification that the target was unarrestable.
- ISP/Jam Network can be used to block DDOS, rollbacks, and other abilities.
- DDOS is globally announced again.
- Review Connection Logs also makes you immune to Jam Network for tomorrow.
- Impersonate allows you to rename your operative to allow for a 50% chance to target either operative. Troll Operative allows you to change another operative’s name.
- Ask the Right Question gives the operative’s hack chance too.
- Doxx works similarly to default Untrusted.
- Midnight Meet is designed to have prosopagnosia on by default (cannot see who met), but many people disliked this, so this may not be the case.
- Review Specialization checks subclass.
- Speech Analysis checks if operatives can win together.
- For the Cause hunts moles and checks win conditions.
- Wiretap either checks operative matching or plea deal offers.
- Review TCP determines if you hacked or not.
- Frame, cover, and ability pool can be selected by the player rather than forced randomly.
- Voting can be silent, shown, or forced.
- There are abilities that can use Broadcast that aren’t Operation Leader.
- There are abilities to manually upload intel for others to download.
- Agents can be arrested when framed. Yep.
- Root does not instantly lose or win the game.
- The Operation Leader may not be Netsec aligned.
- The Agent Leader is now an offensive subclass role.
- There are many other changes, but these are the critical ones.
