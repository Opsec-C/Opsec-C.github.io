### Basic ruleset:

- Games last for X in game days, with each out of game day taking X day/night phases. The first day will be a singular day phase to allow for some roles to get started, processed faster to speed the game up. After this, the general pattern would be 1 night/day phase per day, with 3-5 in game days of gameplay. 
- Each day/night phase will only have 1 vote possible. The first phase to have proper voting will be the 2nd night/day phase.
- Due to the decreased voting and time, Agents/NK/W3C will generally be heavily outnumbered with lower kill potential, only needing to get a kill a day.
- Since games are faster, we can run more games, and game results can affect later games in the campaign if they are part of the same campaign. Players can come and join each individual game without having to play the entire campaign. Earlier games may change the state of later games, with more impactful games later in the campaign.
- Depending on the settings of the game, there can be different role setups, including no OL, no starting FA slot, only mole, only NK, and more. The game ruleset is flexible to any ruleset.
