**Opsec C** is a concept designed to differ from the standard Town of Salem/Untrusted formula that focuses on singular operatives or players with a singular objective and role. Due to a lack of players, especially depending on time zones, and a stale meta that can develop with singular operatives, I came up with this idea to create something a bit different. Opsec C is focused more on the mechanics, although many want the game to be more focused on social deduction, this provides a different kind of social deduction to Untrusted- focused on social strategy involving figuring out who owns what operatives and what each player and operative wants to do, and can be run with a much smaller player count, at least 3 people needed. This also makes it easier to host and more interactive between the specific players, as each player must be more active.

**Opsec R** is a concept designed to differ from the standard Town of Salem/Untrusted formula that focuses on reviving players with potentially different factions, objectives, and roles, along with allowing players to take the Deal to switch factions. This game mode supports fewer players, as players continuously come back as different operatives. Opsec R is also more focused on mechanics, but the social deduction portion changes per day, as players will opt to score higher in a score system by betraying one another to achieve their goals. Opsec R solves issues such as hacking being ineffective in the base game, abuse of voting, dying quickly and having to wait for lengthy periods of time to play again, and not knowing or learning mechanics due to metagaming roles. Opsec R combines paper pirates, randomizer (credits to AstraAegis for Opsec Randomizer), and Dubium’s call system to create an interesting new game mode.

**Opsec D** is pve Untrusted in which you play as the detective to figure out what the opsec looks like in any game state.

**Copyright:** Core ideas and principles come from Untrusted, the game. In no way is this idea (Opsec C) used for profit, it is purely for fun and enjoyment. All rights to significant portions of the idea, such as certain roles, a big portion of the hacking system, day/night cycle, and many other small pieces and parts to the game of Untrusted are borrowed from Knu's game of Untrusted with no intent of profit. The additional roles and significant overhaul in style of play with multiple operatives per player and similar changes are from me (lux).
